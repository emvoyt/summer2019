<h2 id="introduction"> Introduction </h2>

<p> This summer, I received an opportunity to study abroad in Valencia, Spain. While in Spain, I contributed to the Florida State University International Programs travel magazine, <em> Nomadic Noles </em>, and I contributed an article discussing how professors at FSU Valencia arrange their curriculums to take advantage of the opportunities Valencia offers. </p>

<p> To create <em> Nomadic Noles </em>, I participated in a specific Editing, Writing and Media program in Valencia. I took classes ENC4352 and ENC49**, and implemented the knowledge learned into creating an article. I also had the opportunity to take class HUM3920 Spain: Culture and Civilization, which allowed me to learn more about the history and culture of Spain. </p>

<p> However, spending a semester abroad involved plenty of fun to go along with the work. I have compiled memories and pictures onto this site, as a way of cataloging my experiences. </p>

<p> As my home for 5 weeks, I became familiar with the ins and outs of Valencia. I ate traditional food, and visited museums and engaged with the locals. I visited many museums, such as the National Ceramics museum, the Silk Museum, and the Museum at town hall. I frequently visited EL Mercado Central, usually in search of fresh Orange juice. I enjoyed eating paella Valenciana and drinking Horchata with fartons.</p>

<p> From Valencia, the program took a day trip to the city of Peñiscola. Peñiscola is a small city on the coast, which has a large fortress built for protection against pirates. </p>

<h2 id="vienna"> Vienna, Austria </h2>

<p> For my first weekend trip, I ventured to Vienna, Austria. While in Austria, I ate Pork Schnitzel, drank copious amounts of Apple Cider, and had the best Hot Chocolate in life. I visited the Natural history and Science museum, hapsburg and Schöenbrun palace, and took a river tour on the Danube. </p>

<h2 id="madrid"> Madrid, Spain </h2>

<p> FSU took the entire program on a weekend trip to Madrid. While in Madrid, we visited the Prado Museum, and saw work by El Greco, Goya and Velasquez. We also watched a traditional Flamenco show. We also took a visit to The Valley of the Fallen, a national monument built by Franco.</p>

<h6 id="segovia"> Segovia </h6>

<p> From our base in Madrid, we also took a day trip to a town outside of the city, Segovia. Segovia has a roman aqueduct, that can still transport water, even though it is no longer use. Segovia also has the Alcazar, an ancient castle used the the monarchs of Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand lived there, among other monarchs. It has been many things since then, and is now a museum. </p>
